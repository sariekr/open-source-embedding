    "question": "How many days of treatment are included in what the manufacturer calls a 'one month supply'?",
    "answer": "7 days - the reviewer notes it's actually a one week supply despite being marketed as a one month supply.",
    "context": "First... I purchased these directly from the manufacturer - thus it doesn't say \"verified\" purchase for me. I went to the manufacturer because I wanted to try a smaller set (1 month set) which was not offered on Amazon when I purchased it. 1. A \"one month supply\" is really only a one WEEK supply - the \"effects\" are supposed to last one month. Misleading to say the least. Should say it's a ONE WEEK supply. 2. I took pictures that show NO difference to my eye. NOTE: I used exactly as described on instructions. ALSO... my front, top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays. Supposedly this system is safe AND effective on dental work as well as natural teeth. I didn't see it. 3. It is messy and a two step process... Tube # 1 is the a super stain treater and then tube #2 which you apply after using tube #1. The pic I have included was after tube #2. NOTE: The tubes themselves were a serious pain... most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with \"careful bending\" per instruction. I think I had ONE tube that actually opened without considerable force, which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment. They also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining. It has a soft brush like tip. 4. Initially the solution didn't really effect me one way or the other, however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive. I have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment, which I chose to do in the mornings. 5. It is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort. You can taste it. With a bit of mint or something mixed in... but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor. 6. In the end, photos don't lie. I don't see any improvement at all. Photo number 1 is before... Feb 17... Photo number 2 is Feb 23. The rest were photos I would like to see if I were considering a purchase. Hope it helps. In my opinion these are a waste of time AND money. I included the photos so you could make your own decision. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but honestly, I will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from Amazon.",

    "question": "How many reminders can be recorded at once?",
    "answer": "Up to ten reminders can be recorded and run simultaneously.",
    "context": "I love this voice-activated clock! It's extremely easy to use, and lets me record daily or one-time reminders for absolutely everything (time to leave for an appointment, time to take medicine, time to turn off cooling fans after they've run for 30 minutes, etc.). It speaks with a pleasing, polite female voice, and easily understands both male and female voice commands. If there is moderate background noise, it may not understand some spoken commands, but muting the TV took care of this for me. The clock is very easy to set up. You insert batteries (to hold your custom settings during power outages); plug the clock in; and use the manual setup ONCE to set the month, day, and year. After that, you simply say \"Reminder assistant\". The clock will respond, \"What can I do for you?\", and wait for you to answer with one of the 12 standard commands (for example, \"What time is it?\", \"What day is it?\", \"Record reminder\", \"Play reminder\", \"Set alarm\", \"Snooze\"). If you can't remember a phrase, you say \"Help\", and the clock will explain all of the commands. To perform any function, all you need to do is follow the clock's voice prompts. You do have to use exact command phrases (which is why my clock is named \"Jo\", after the strict, do-it-by-the-book cop in the SyFy series \"Eureka\"). I would like to be able to record my own command phrases, but of course that would make the clock harder to set up, and would probably make it cost more, too. You record reminder messages--anything that fits into six seconds--in your own voice, tell the clock the time for the reminder, and whether or not it is a one-time or recurring reminder. At the assigned time, the clock plays your message, and repeats it until you say \"Reminder off\". Reminders apparently do not turn off until you issue a command--I tested one reminder for 10 minutes, and it did NOT turn off automatically. The clock's big, blue, digital display is very bright, even when set to \"dim\". All of the clock functions can be performed manually, using buttons on the clock back--but it is rarely necessary to use manual commands. There is an on/off switch on the clock back that controls the daily alarm clock, which I have set to permanent \"off\", because I use the clock for short-term reminders, and to keep track of the day of the week (it's easy to forget the day, when you work from home). For short-term reminders, I much prefer to use this clock instead of my Talking Timer ( ), because the Talking Timer has a distracting vocal minute-by-minute countdown for the last ten minutes (useful for cooking), and is a single-event timer. The iTalk Reminder Assistant Voice-Activated Clock allows you to record up to ten reminders, which run simultaneously, and it simply plays your recorded reminder when \"Time's Up!\" (without any countdown).",

    "question": "How long should you use this neck support device according to the review?",
    "answer": "10 minutes, with the option to go up to 15 minutes.",
    "context": "Simple instructions are provided but it is unclear of the correct positioning of the neck without looking at the photos on the Amazon site because the sketch in the instructions does not match the slope of this \"pillow.\" Note that I have tried three other varieties of pillows and this is as good as the 5 star one listed below. The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because the price is double what others charge. - 5 stars - 4 stars - 4 stars For 10 minutes (one can go up to 15 minutes) I just wedged this under my neck with the open wave in the back of my head and let my head fall back. It is super comfortable to use. This actually works for me to help but not eliminate my neck pain. I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me a similar exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back. Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is firm yet soft enough in the center to be comfortable which is better for alignment. It works great and did not take any getting used to like the foam device I have. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 10 minutes. In summary, this works for me but the current price of $49.95 is extremely expensive for this. Had it been $29 or less, this would have received 5 stars. I just wish it came with better pictures in the instructions.",

    "context": "I watch lots of skincare videos. Massage is a key step to increase blood circulation, naturally lift lax skin, increase collagen production and help products penetrate deeper. This massager has three different modes with three intensity levels for each. The cleansing mode warms skin and helps open pores for deep cleaning. The iontophoresis mode is ideal to use with a sheet mask to increase circulation and improve elasticity. The transmission mode uses red light to brighten skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production and increase product penetration. Use this mode after applying your entire skincare routine. Each cycle runs for four minutes before the auto-shutoff is engaged. The unit doesn't operate unless the massage head is in full contact with skin. You may need to apply pressure for it to start.

    "answer": "The scale shows no deviation in repeated test weighings, and results were verified against a different scale for comparison.",
    "context": "My definition of 'attractive' may be disputed, but when I say that this is accurate I mean it. The first thing I did after I unboxed the review sample that I received from the manufacturer was to test just how accurate it it. A few notes: I am not going to regurgitate the product description or specs on this page. I will give my impression and highlights that led me to give this five stars. Also, mine shipped with an included tape measure, which was not mentioned in the description at the time of this review. It's actually a high quality one that has an auto-retract mechanism that adds even more value to this set. I test a lot of scales so I have standard weights that are used for calibration, and in this case comparison. My approach is to use different weights, then repeat the weighing. There was no deviation among the results from all tests. In addition I also performed the same tests using a different scale and received the same results. My conclusion is this is accurate per the product description right out of the box. You can switch among pounds, kilograms and stones by pressing a button on the underside of the scale. Plus this is accurate to one decimal place (in .2 increments), so you can see detailed results if you are battling the pounds (or kilos or stones), as well as weigh objects. A few things that I especially like about this scale are the large display, which is a big deal at my age, and the blue lit background. I also like the fact that it will come alive as soon as I step on it and give me the bad or good news after a few second lag, and will go back to sleep shortly after I step off of it. Among the scales that I have tested this one stands out in ease of use, display quality and accuracy. It's heavy and well made, and the fifteen dollar price tag at the time of this review makes it an incredible bargain. If you could see one in person you'd be as impressed as I am.",

    "answer": "120 calories per serving",
    "context": "Well, I've been trying out various protein shakes to try and have something readily available for meal replacements. Thanks to some mobility problems, I can't get to the refrigerator when I get hungry, so having something available where I am was important. We've tried several flavors of Spiru-tein shakes now. We got various packets, and got a whole can of the egg nog. If you like the egg nog that comes in the wax cartons like a quart of milk during the holidays, then you will like this one. I needed something that would mix well and taste okay with WATER, not milk, as I cannot get to the milk. We tried this one both ways, and I love it both ways! The milk made it taste like a creamy cup of rich eggnog from a carton - definitely not like a diet shake. The water made a very tasty version also - I use a shaker with a blender ball (vs a blender), and very cold water. I shook it like crazy, then let it sit for a minute. It mixes very easily, and I had no problems at all with the shaker. The result was a super creamy shake, thick enough to drink with a straw if desired. It has a nice nutmeg aftertaste. The color is eggnog yellow (why mention color? Some of Spiru-tein's shakes have some funky colors!), and totally acceptable. It coated the blender cup as well. The only downside, if you can say there is one, is that it uses fructose as a sweetener. I prefer stevia myself. At least it is not aspartame, which would be a deal breaker. It uses only ONE scoop per 8 ounces of liquid, and has 120 calories, 14 grams of protein and 15 grams of carb (making it a little bit on the high side of the carb). However, it also has choline and inositol in this flavor, which adds to the fat burning potential. I don't drink this to bulk up, rejuvenate after lifting weights, or any of the athletic uses. I am using protein shakes as meal replacements to help shed some weight. So, the relatively lower protein (compared to the muscle shakes) suits me just fine. They say this is a holiday edition. They need to offer it year-round. It is fantastic! A definite favorite in our house, with six thumbs up. We'll definitely buy this one again!",

    "context": "Pretty good! Helps keep my sanity when I get hungry before my main meal. I think it makes for a quick snack- either to take care of a sweet tooth need, or just need something to nosh on to take care of hungries before next meal. When I am on the go all day, I often dont eat anything until dinner (Im just not hungry, and copious amounts of coffee and/or a smoothie takes care of my need to masticate a meal), but.. sometimes I do get a little hungry. OK, sometimes a lot. lol. I pack some snack bars just in case, but sometimes I want a better mouth feel/different texture than what a dry bar provides. SO give me cheese stick, olives, meat stick.. and now these yam sticks. Of all the other options, these are the easiest for me as they are room temperature stable. Now I can have one of these and maybe a handful of nuts, and I am satisfied enough to hold off until dinner. Has a light, mild taste. I think kids would like this as it isnt as strong as some sweet potatoes. I know some of the flavor is dependent on the type of sweet potato/yam used, and region. That is the extent of my expertise, though haha. The texture is decent. It is a soft with a little bit of chew. Easy to eat. I have another yam product I prefer (about as mild, but little more chew), but I would totally buy these again. If only because I can control myself better. This is 80 calories per stick, where as the other is a bag at 180 per serving/bag. Not bad, but I dont always need that much at once (but I cant control myself haha). So different items purchased for different reasons. If you want to get fancy, this would be delightful paired with a slice of turkey or chicken, then maybe a slice of cheese all rolled in a small soft tortilla shell. Or ditch the meat, and add in avocado. Hmm, making myself hungry now. Yammy: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SYBSSN3",

    "question": "What amount of the powder does the reviewer recommend starting with for new users?",
    "answer": "Half a teaspoon at first, then work up to a teaspoon.",
    "context": "It has been a tough winter. We have barely seen the sun for weeks at a time. That has a tendency to make a person cranky and feeling more tired than normal. I have been trying to get more fresh, raw, and green into my body to help counteract this winter problem. Let's take a look at this.. WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This is a pretty large foil sealed bag of barley juice powder. Notice it says JUICE. That is essential when you are taking barely green. Some people think that buying ground up barlely greens is just as good- it isn't. This is very bright green and smells VERY fresh. HOW DO I USE THIS? I do not put this into things, but I prefer to get some refrigerator cold water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, and put a teaspoon of this powder in. I run it for one cycle which is barely a minute, and then I have the most luscious fresh green drink you can get without fresh greens. There is a lovely layer of foam on it and it tastes heavenly. DOES IT REALLY TASTE THAT GOOD? I must preface this by saying that I have had varieties of green powders, fresh green drinks including fresh wheatgrass and kale smoothies. I know what fresh juice from many greens tastes like as I have made them from time to time. This powder is one of the best I have had since the days when I used to take Green Magma from Japan, which was one of the original barley juice powders. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO WHEATGRASS? This has a sweetness that is not quite as intense as wheatgrass juice is. It is easier to drink in my opinion than wheatgrass. DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE? I will say that using barley juice powder helps a lot to add energy to my day, helps me to sleep better and it does tend to detox. I would recommend you start with a half teaspoon at first if you are not used to this kind of product. Work up to a teaspoon. It also does keep me regular and not feeling quite so wiped out in times of stress. DID I GET A DETOX REACTION? I eat really healthy, do I did not get a detox reaction, but I also made sure to start with half a teaspoon and work up to a teaspoon. It is important to go slowly with this as it can be a bit much if you are not used to it. THE BOTTOM LINE This has given me energy, a more positive outlook, helped me feel supplemented, and definitely is helping me through winter very well compared to not having it This tastes fresh and makes a wonderful drink. MY RATING FIVE STARS. I will be buying this again. I stopped getting barley juice powder because I just could not find a really good quality one.. until now. (grins).",

    "question": "Is this broom and dustpan set worth buying for someone who struggles with storage and organization?",
    "answer": "Yes, it's highly recommended as it clips together, stands up well, stores compactly, and performs effectively for cleaning.",
    "context": "In my house we have a sock monster- who eats only one sock of every pair. Then there is the mess monster. He leaves a mess that no one knows anything about. We also have another monster which has been frustrating me - the dustpan monster. This monster not only makes dustpans disappear for months at a time, but when they come back, they have bites out of them or corners missing. When I saw this, I was ecstatic. Let's take a look. WHAT IS THIS SET LIKE? This set comes in a box of parts. You have to put them together, but the instructions are easy to follow and loaded with pictures for those who are visual learners. Once the set is assembled, you end up with a broom and a dustpan that clip together when not in use. HOW DOES THIS PERFORM? I have to say many brooms have left me wanting more. This one, however, works just right. It is not the BEST broom I have ever used, but it is definitely way better than many of them. The cleaning feature of the dustpan is fantastic. It really works. DOES THE DUSTPAN LEAVE DIRT ON THE FLOOR? If I press down the dustpan lightly, I find that 95% of the dirt goes in the first time. I might have to press down with my foot for very fine dirt, but for the most part, it works well. DOES THE DUSTPAN LOCK? The dustpan locks into place, but it also is not hard to press down to use either. There is no release button, it is pressure activated. IS THERE A HOLE TO HANG THIS FROM? No, there is not a hole to hang this from. You will have to use a clip broom hanger style to put this on the wall. DOES THIS STAND UP? When this is put together and the dustpan is up, the counterbalance of the broom causes this to stand up pretty well. THE BOTTOM LINE I am very happy to have this set. I love the dustpan which seems to work quite well and also has the great cleaning feature for the broom bristles. It definitely does clean off pet fur and dust. MY RATING FIVE STARS. I LOVE THIS SET. I have looked for a long time for a set like this- but the best part is that it stores well and stands up nicely too- It is compact.",

    "question": "How should I mix this powder for drinking?",
    "answer": "Either blend it into fresh vegetable juice using a hand blender, or mix with cold water in a mini blender.",
    "context": "When it comes to winter, sometimes we don't always have access to the vegetables that we want to have. I love to have juice, but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times. Having this powder is a great alternative. WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE? This powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely. It is cut open and then you can reseal it. The powder is raw beets, but is freeze dried so you HAVE to keep this closed at all times, before and after you access it. HOW DO I USE IT? I either put this in my vegetable juice that I make fresh and blend it in my hand blender, or if desperate, I add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender. I also have used it to make a Keto version of red forest cake which is OUT OF THIS WORLD, by the way. You just have to add more liquid to counteract the powder. THE BOTTOM LINE For a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy, this is an excellent alternative. The powder is easy to use, tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water, or you can use it in recipes too. MY RATING FIVE STARS. I LOVE how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake, I am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when I run out- I will buy more.",

We used to then drape it over the bathtub to let it dry, which took a few hours. I had no idea there was a yoga mat cleaner out there. I was ordering a bar of soap from this company and when I added it to my cart, it showed suggestions for other products and this was one of them. I decided to take a chance and order it since the reviews were good and it seemed to have non-chemical ingredients. I would never use a traditional cleaner on the mat since our skin directly touches it and I didn't want the material of the yoga mat to deteriorate. So when I got this, I tried it out on one section of the mat and it seemed to work great. I got the non scented one since my husband would not be thrilled with his yoga mat smelling \"fruity\" or \"florally\". I have now used it several times on both of our mats and this works great and is a much easier process than our original method of getting them clean. I love that this comes with a cleaning cloth so I can just throw both of them in the workout bag instead of having to pack an extra towel. This cleaner is amazing and has made our process so much easier! Next time I might have to try one of the scented ones and just see if hubby notices.",

    "question": "Does this magnesium supplement help lower high blood pressure?",
    "answer": "Yes, the reviewer's blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/60 after taking this liquid magnesium, leading to reduced blood pressure medication.",
    "context": "A month ago my blood pressure was 140/80. I had atrial flutter issues and my heart was acting bizarre. I started taking a Potassium and Magnesium product and saw some results. Then I read The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean and stated taking this liquid magnesium. I noticed good results with magnesium and now my blood pressure went down to 110/60. So my nurse practitioner has halved my blood pressure medication and I have an appointment in a month to check it again. If you do take this liquid magnesium and have high blood pressure make sure you are working with your doctor or nurse because your medication may need to be adjusted. They also did an EKG on me and said my heart was normal and I told them: \"Well I'm taking magnesium.\" They also did blood tests and said they were normal. I'm not sure my nurse actually realized that the magnesium had lowered my blood pressure. Here are some of my experiences day by day at the start: Day 1: I took 1/4 teaspoon in 16.9 fluid ounces water. It made me feel relaxed and I slept well. Day 2: I got ambitious and took 1/2 teaspoon in a large container of iced tea and it only tasted a bit salty. Sipped over a couple of hours and it seemed to relax me and take the edge off my anxiety. I thought it was giving me a lot of energy and made my heart beats really strong. Day 3: Backed off a bit and took 1/4 teaspoon in a small amount of cranberry juice. Tasted salty and a bit bitter so didn't want to do that again. Decided it needed more liquid to make it palatable. Day 4: Took 1/4 teaspoon in a pint (2 cups) of coconut water. My anxious thoughts stopped and my mind felt calm and almost as if my thoughts were not as loud. Day 5: Took 1/4 teaspoon in 2 cups bottled water. Felt as if my system was detoxing and cleaning out. Day 6: Felt like toxins were being released so drank more water. Day 7: Decided to try taking the magnesium liquid in capsules. That way you can't taste and salty or bitter flavor. Day 8: While waiting to get capsules, took 1/2 teaspoon magnesium liquid in iced tea. Day 9: Put 1/4 teaspoon magnesium in 3 veggie capsules. Swallowed them down with no issues. Since then I've been taking 1/2 teaspoon magnesium liquid in five veggie capsules. I fill them up with a syringe and take them right away, not letting them sit around to dissolve. It is a little extra effort but it keeps my atrial flutter under control and I feel better in general. You may want to wipe the capsules off a bit after filling. I just use a napkin. That way you don't taste any of the liquid. That is my best solution and how I'm going to continue to take this magnesium. My cautions are to start slow with drops or 1/4 teaspoon and work up slowly to 1/2 teaspoon a day. Also read The Magnesium Miracle to understand all the reasons to take this product and how to take it. I would not recommend taking it straight, always dilute it in at least 2 or more cups of water to make it palatable. I will say this magnesium does NOT have laxative effects like other magnesium products do. That is a good thing if you want to leave the house! So my experience has been positive. Please consult with your doctor before taking any supplements as your medications may need to be adjusted. ~The Rebecca Review",

    "context": "The Verilux HappyEyes Floor lamp is an especially versatile light with numerous applications. It will brighten your entire desk while typing and is perfect to use while reading on the couch, in your favorite chair or basically anywhere you choose. Even while working on projects like knitting, puzzles or crafts, this light is very helpful. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and keep stealing it while I'm reviewing. This makes a perfect gift for anyone who loves to read. My husband loves it because it makes maps look especially bright and clear. He says the colors stand out more and I love the way it brings out the text in books. If you don't want to move this from room to room (although it is not too heavy), buy two or one for each desk or one for the office and even the bedroom. I could use at least three of these around the house because I rarely stay in one room for very long. Some of the ways I've used this lamp is to see when reading, but you can also brighten a room by pointing the lamp at the ceiling. The super flexible arm allows the light to point in any direction. There are also two brightness levels so you can decide on the brightness you prefer. The advantages of this light include: Reduced Eyestrain Less Glare - the light has a special glare reducing Parabolic grid that covers the light bulb Energy Efficient Long lasting 27 Watt bulb - Flicker free bright white light that simulates natural daylight. A free utility tray was included and can be attached and removed very easily. Perfect if you want to leave your reading glasses or a pen and paper by the lamp. I wasn't sure how this style of lamp would fit into my home, but it actually looks good in every room. ~The Rebecca Review",

We have several other masks cloth and disposable masks to compare these masks against. I must tell everyone these masks rock! Seriously, this mask is soft. Soft like a high quality, tight woven, brushed cotton, and soft t-shirt that feels so good I can’t wait for it to be washed. Made in the USA by Americans look up their website! I don’t know them but I know where they are and they stopped production and are only making face masks.. The mask has adjustable ear loops, a pouch for inserts like those charcoal filters if you so choose. The mask is so comfortable. But, here are more reasons why I will wear this mask every time I can because of a unique feature of the strap that goes behind my head, furthermore not putting pressure on my head or neck, simply rests on my back so I can take the mask off when safe and it simply hangs on my chest or lower. No longer having to put it In the visor, risk it touching anything but my shirt. Period. I don’t have to look for it when I get out of the truck or put it in the pocket my phone was in, as cellphones are nasty even though you clean them, because I simply raise my mask up by the ear loops and slip it on my ears and snug the strap if it’s loose. Double layer full coverage mask. From bridge of my nose to under my chin. Comfortable all day! I don’t use the carbon filters. If needed, I would put a disposable mask in the pocket area on a as necessary basis. I don’t think I have been so excited about a product since my first boom box. Just kidding; since my iPhone. These comes in two different sizes. I wear the XL. I have wide cheek bones and I’m chubby. My spouse wears the Large and has a narrower jawline shaped face and chubby.

The velcro is covered with a protective fleece strip, so be sure to remove it, or you will think it's the worst Velcro ever. LOL. Yes, it took me a minute to discover that because most manufacturers don't bother to protect the Velcro. The overall quality is excellent, and this belt can be adjusted to find the sweet spot of soothing relief. With all of my injuries, I would consider myself the queen of pain, and this is one of the best support belts I have found so far, There is nothing else like it, and I highly recommend it for those difficult to treat areas. Now, if I could only find something this good for my shoulder, I would be in heaven! ** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

    "question": "How long does the hook-and-loop (Velcro) closure last before wearing out?",
    "answer": "After approximately 125 wearings over 6 months, the hook-and-loop closure wears out and starts separating, requiring replacement 2-3 times per year with daily use.",
    "context": "- UPDATE - After 6 months of on and off usage (I would guess about 125 wearings) the main band hook-and-loop (Velcro is one brand of hook-and-loop) type closure is shot! The 2 straps start separating as soon as they are attached. One good cough or bending over and SCRITCH!...it pops open. I am most certainly not a big person so I am not stressing the connection in that respect. ALL hook-and loop does wear out. The hooks start to get straightened out with repeated pulls of the loop side and subsequently they stop grabbing and holding the loop. The highest quality products have thick, stout hooks that last a very long time. I feel that should you plan on wearing this item everyday you may be buying 2 or 3 a year. Aside from this issue rendering the brace unwearable I still feel this is a fantastic brace. *ORIGINAL POST* This is not the first posture corrector I have purchased through Amazon but it will be the last. This is a very well engineered and constructed product and I commend the seller/manufacturer on delivering a corrector that actually works! I had been going through progressive slouching, shoulder slump, and FHP (Forward Head Position)...to the layman like me that just means not looking straight ahead but down to differing degrees. I had been told that I was looking down all the time. In actively assessing myself I found that to be true. This observation of slumping over and head position led me to understand why I was going through progressive upper back, shoulder, and neck pain. Every morning and evening I was on an acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimen. My previous posture corrector experience was awful. Poorly engineered, uncomfortable, and one size fits all seems to be the norm. In receiving this product box I was a bit apprehensive; I didn't want further disappointment. I gave this purchase a 4 star review for two reasons. I really want to give a 5 star review because the product ACTUALLY WORKS AS ADVERTISED but there are a couple of issues. If I could give a 4.5 star review I would. For better or worse positive change occurs on Amazon through the process of accurate and honest reviews. My first reason for not rating my experience as a 5 may seem petty to some but I feel it has importance. On opening the box and removing the brace there was not a single stitch of product literature included. In my humble opinion, basic information regarding the product itself, guarantee explanation with return/refund information, and some basic seller contact information should have been included. There were none of the pages that can be seen on the Amazon website that are just great. Copies of the photos and fitting instructions should also have been with the product. I was going back and forth between my computer and my bathroom mirror to assure proper fitment. When I first put this on it did not feel right and I found that I was wearing it too low by looking at the photo of the model. For future reference, when not logged on to the computer, having package inserts would be fantastic. Now to the corrector. Once I was properly fitted it was immediately obvious that this device was going to prove beneficial. When I first strapped it on it seemed that I would only receive moderate correction. I realized that I was not holding my shoulders, neck, and head up straight and in proper alignment before stretching and attaching the shoulder straps to the belly band. Upon doing this correctly, a significant amount of support was felt. By pulling pretty tight on the straps while in proper posture before attachment of the bands, my alignment is now perfect. My posture without the corrector was poor...but not as bad as I have seen with other people. In order to retain proper alignment with the corrector I had to give the straps a pretty good stretch. I am 5'11\" tall and 190 pounds. It is only reasonable that the device straps will have to be pulled tighter for a bulkier person; there is just going to be more physical resistance to correction. If you are smaller than me such tension may not be required. This is where my second issue is keeping me from a 5 star review comes up. For those of use requiring extra tension on the straps to maintain proper spinal alignment, the straps can \"cut\" into the armpits to an uncomfortable degree. Some sort of well designed underarm cushioning would be greatly appreciated. Lastly, I can only wear this brace for about 2 hours before my back muscles start aching. I do not consider this to be a negative in any way...actually it is quite the opposite. This lets me know the brace is working as advertised. Those muscles in my back have been stretching and stretching over the years and are at the heart of my poor posture. They are not enjoying being \"re-compressed\". Tough! Over time muscle fibers begin to grow together. This corrector, I feel, will facilitate just that. Take tension off the brace as soon as you begin to feel any of the aching I have described above. Continued use after that point will cause discomfort for some time after the brace is removed. For some people I imagine this period of initial correction may be as short as 45 minutes to an hour (perhaps even less for the elderly...I am going to get one for my 70 year old mother if she gives in to trying it. It takes time to gain new muscle memory. The longer you use the device every day the length of time you will be able to wear it comfortably will most likely extend. In using this corrector, these aching muscles will begin to calm down over time. The support is not just holding things in place, it is forcing the body to improve itself. I fully believe that actual POSTURAL HEALING will take place and down the road I will only need the support as a reminder rather than a maintainer. I wear a T-shirt every day and even when tightly tucked in the corrector is virtually invisible underneath it. From when I first put the corrector on in the morning I do not take it off until bedtime. I simply go through comfortable cycles of tensioning the main strap and releasing it when I feel it is needed...the device is lightweight and unobtrusive. Only the tightest or sheerest of clothing would give away it's presence. Bravo Tigoof! You really have a winner here and I highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing postural issues such as mine (slouching, Forward Head Position, and shoulder slumping) and suffering from the chronic neck and shoulder pain that I was. As an aside, my working at the computer for any extended period of time would get to feeling fiery in the upper back. I don't do computer work now without the brace, and no longer experience that discomfort. I HIGHLY recommend this support to long duration computer users. This is a fantastic product you should feel very secure in purchasing. The few negative things I mentioned are more than likely issues specific to me (or perhaps to other people my size or larger). I am confident that if you order the correct size and find the just-right fit for you this corrector will prove itself to be quite an asset. If you don't feel just that way, contact the seller. They are fantastic to work with. I can't wait for my few issues to be dealt with in some fashion for all future purchasers so I can I can come back and give this product a SOLID 5 STAR RATING! I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. Good Day & Good Back, STLaffoon",

Guests to my home that do not have bad knees also state how much they like having the extra boost on the toilet. I had a different brand of toilet seat booster prior to this that had a much more comfortable seating portion,it was wider and was made of a better feeling plastic however after about two years of use the locking mechanism on that seat failed. This new seat is made of a harder plastic that is not as comfortable and the width is not as generous however the side screw is on the backside rather than the front side and the seat is much more secure, there is no wobble once that seat is fully screwed in. The screws are very easy to adjust with large wing nut typed screws that are also me made of plastic. That being said I do believe it will give me a good two years of use. I would recommend this product one star deducted for for the narrowness of the seat.",

It is very gentle to the skin and works well to cleanse as well as tone the skin when just sprayed lightly over your skin. I would highly recommend this toner especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. It's really a perfect toner for these skin types.
